# ü™ô InheritChain ‚Äî Cross-Chain Decentralized Will Execution Protocol

InheritChain is a decentralized, cross-chain inheritance management system that allows a **testator** to create a legally binding, multi-chain digital will, and enables **beneficiaries** to securely claim their inheritance ‚Äî with **dispute resolution**, **Chainlink-powered truth verification**, and **automated CCIP-based asset transfers** across Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and more.

## üîó Live on: Sepolia (Primary), Polygon, Avalanche, Base

---

## üìå Features

* **Smart Will Registry**: Create will with off-chain asset % for privacy and on-chain beneficiary list and willhash-A tamper resistent proof of off chain data.
* **Smart Wallet Deployment**: Deploy vaults on any supported chain to hold testator's assets - managed by ccip.
* **Challenge Window**: A transparent 10-day contestation window to allow dispute of false claims.
* **Automated Finalization**: Uses Chainlink Automation to trigger execution after challenge period.
* **Chainlink Any API**: Fetches from a simulated Government Api and Verifies if the testator has passed away.
* **Chainlink CCIP**: Transfers funds to beneficiaries across chains with just a single call.
* **Multi-party Challenge Protocol**: Stake-based dispute mechanism between beneficiaries.
* **MongoDB-Backed Off-chain Storage**: Efficient off-chain will metadata and asset records.

```
Frontend (React)
   |
   |----> WillCreator (Sepolia): Creates will ‚Üí stores metadata in MongoDB ‚Üí stores hash+beneficiaries on-chain
   |
   |----> SmartWalletManager: Deploys smart wallets on Polygon, Avalanche, Sepolia via contracts
   |
   |----> BeneficiaryDashboard: Shows wills involving the current user
   |
   |----> InheritanceActions:
         - Initiate Inheritance (0.1 ETH stake)
         - Challenge (0.01 ETH)

## üìù Inheritance Workflow

1. **Will Creation** (Testator)

   * Creates a will from Sepolia network
   * Will object is stored in **MongoDB** with:

     * Testator address
     * Beneficiary details and allocations
   * On-chain `WillContract` stores the Will hash and beneficiary addresses.

2. **Smart Wallet Deployment**

   * From the `SmartWalletManager`, the testator deploys **smart wallets** (vaults) on multiple chains.
   * These vaults hold assets to be distributed to beneficiaries.
   * Mapping of `chain ‚Üí smart wallet address` is saved in MongoDB.

3. **Initiation of Inheritance** (Any Beneficiary)

   * A beneficiary starts the inheritance process by staking **0.1 ETH**.
   * Status is set to `PendingExecution`.
   * Timestamp is recorded to enforce the **10-day challenge window**.

4. **Challenge Phase**

   * Any other beneficiary can challenge by staking **0.01 ETH**.
   * The testator can challenge **for free** (auto-cancels the process).
   * Multiple challenges can be made within the 10-day window.

5. **Automation-Triggered Finalization**

   * After 10 days, Chainlink Automation checks each will:

     * If **no challenges**: the 0.1 ETH is returned to initiator and execution begins.
     * If **challenges present**: a **Chainlink Any API call** is triggered.

6. **Verification**

   * Chainlink Any API (external adapter or oracle) checks off-chain truth (e.g., obituary database).

     * If **testator is confirmed deceased**:

       * Will executes.
       * Challengers lose 0.01 ETH each, which is kept by the contract.
     * If **testator is alive**:

       * Initiator loses 0.1 ETH.
       * Challengers split it equally (minus a 0.01 ETH protocol fee).

7. **Cross-Chain Inheritance Execution**

   * `MainCoordinator` on Sepolia initiates a **CCIP message** to each chain.
   * For every destination chain:

     * Encodes a message: `"transfer"`, `wallet`, `to`, `amount`
     * CCIP sends to the `LogicContractReceiver` deployed on that chain.

8. **Receiver-side Logic**

   * On Polygon/Avalanche:

     * `LogicContractReceiver` receives the CCIP message.
     * Extracts target wallet, beneficiary, and amount.
     * Calls `SmartWallet.transfer(to, amount)` ‚Äî transferring native tokens from vault to the beneficiary.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Chainlink Integrations

### ‚úÖ 1. Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)

Used for **cross-chain value + instruction transfer**.

* `MainCoordinator.sol` (Sepolia):

  * Constructs and sends `EVM2AnyMessage`
  * Contains: target chain selector, receiver address, ABI-encoded action

* `LogicContractReceiver.sol` (Polygon, Avalanche):

  * Receives CCIP payload
  * Calls transfer on smart wallet contract on that chain

### ‚úÖ 2. Chainlink Any API

Used to **verify testator death** status off-chain.

* Triggered during `finalizeExecution()` if the will is challenged
* Example API: `https://my-death-check-api.com/isDeceased?address=0x...`
* Oracle verifies off-chain status and returns boolean

### ‚úÖ 3. Chainlink Automation

Used to **trigger `finalizeExecution()`** automatically after 10-day timeout.

* Registered Upkeep watches all `PendingExecution` wills
* Executes logic:

  * No challenge ‚Üí proceed directly
  * Challenge ‚Üí trigger Chainlink API
  * Updates will status + starts CCIP transfers
